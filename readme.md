## Description ##

Features:

* Logs out all events triggered on `wp.customize`.
* Logs out additions and changes to to `wp.customize.state`.
* Logs changes to the `active` and `expanded` states for panels, sections, and controls.
* Logs out messages sent and received by the pane (controls) and preview.
* Logs out dynamic addition and removal of panels, sections, controls, partials, and settings (after the `ready` event triggers).
* The `wp.customize` object from the Customizer preview is made persistently available from the parent frame via `CustomizerDevTools.previewCustomize`. This reference is updated whenever the preview refreshes, so you no longer have to change the frame window context to access this object.
* In the same way, the current Customizer preview `window` is exposed as `CustomizerDevTools.previewWindow`.  This is a shortcut for doing `wp.customize.previewer.targetWindow.get()`, and it has the added benefit of allowing the browser's dev tools to provide auto-completion.
